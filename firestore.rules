/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ReceptionRGSTR application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a company-centric security model where access to employee and consumption
 * data is primarily controlled by the company to which the data belongs.
 * The rules prioritize authorization independence by denormalizing the 'companyId' into employee and consumption documents.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database is structured as follows:
 * /companies/{companyId} - Contains company information.
 * /companies/{companyId}/employees/{employeeId} - Contains employee data for a specific company.
 * /companies/{companyId}/consumptions/{consumptionId} - Contains consumption records for a specific company.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Data is segregated by 'companyId' for secure and efficient listing within each company.
 * - Authorization rules are written without relying on 'get()' calls to parent documents for better performance and security.
 * - Write permissions to employee and consumption data are restricted and depend on authorization logic.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'companyId' is denormalized (copied) into the employee and consumption documents.
 * This avoids the need for costly 'get()' calls to the parent 'company' document when evaluating security rules.
