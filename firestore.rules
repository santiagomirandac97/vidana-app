/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ReceptionRGSTR application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a company-based data access model. Data for employees and consumptions is nested under company documents.
 * Only authenticated users can access data, and writes are generally disallowed in this prototype phase, except for company creation.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /companies/{companyId}: Stores company information. Top-level collection.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/employees/{employeeId}: Stores employee data. Subcollection under companies.
 * - /companies/{companyId}/consumptions/{consumptionId}: Stores consumption data. Subcollection under companies.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing all companies is disallowed for security.
 * - Employee and consumption writes are disallowed.
 * - Authorization is scoped to company ID.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `companyId` is denormalized within each employee and consumption document, enabling authorization rules without extra `get()` calls.
